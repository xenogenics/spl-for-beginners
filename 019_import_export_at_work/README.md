This application also shows how two different main composites can be

As an aside, there is also a demonstration of using a Custom operator

Note: This application doesn't work in the Standalone launch mode.
Since Export and Import operators are involved, you must start your
Streams instance from the Streams Explorer view and then submit
the two composites using the Distributed launch configuration.

You can verify the results of this application either in the PE log
files or via the Streams instance graph from the Streams Explorer view.

In Streams 4.x onwards, PE log files are available for viewing in a new location:
/tmp/Streams-<domain_id>/logs/<host_name>/instances/<streams_instance_name>/jobs/<job_id>/pec.pe.<pe_id>.stdouterror
