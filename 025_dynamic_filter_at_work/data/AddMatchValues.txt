# ==========================================
# This file is used to demonstrate the DynamicFilter operator.
# If you want to allow a tuple match to happen i.e. not getting filtered,
# you can simply add a CSV tuple data at the very last line of this file.
#
# tuple<rstring symbol, rstring tradeType>;
#
# The following are the supported ticker symbols by this application:
# GM, PFE, F, LLY, BMS, IBM, GOOG, AMAT, GE, AMZN
#
# For example, if you want to match all the IBM stocks with Buy, you have to
# add a line as shown below without the # character at the beginning.
# After adding that line, press Enter and save the file.
# IBM, buy
#
# For example, if you want to match all the GE stocks with Sell, you have to
# add a line as shown below without the # character at the beginning.
# After adding that line, press Enter and save the file.
# GE, sell
