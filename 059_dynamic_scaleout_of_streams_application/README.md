This SPL composite is the self contained application that makes up
the price calculation engine. This composite provides the
code for importing the price calculation requests coming from 
the DynamicScaleout composite. It also calls the C++ primitive operator
that encapsulates the price calculation code. Finally, this
composite exports the result stream coming from the pricer
operator. Binary code for this composite can be deployed and run in
parallel as multiple pricing engine instances on several machines.
But, this example is configured to scale multiple pricing engines across
several CPU cores on a single machine. This can be easily reconfigured
to run on individual server machines.

 This application is built, run, and stopped using bash script files.
 For complete details about building, running, and stopping this application,
 please look inside the file named "readme.txt" available at the root of the 
 "dynamic_scaleout" project directory.

This SPL composite is the test jig that drives the price
calculation engines running in parallel. This composite provides the
feeder (source), collector (sink), aggregation and performance
timing measurement logic. It works in concert with another SPL composite
named "com.ibm.streams.pricing.Pricer". This application is designed in such
a way to be elastic i.e. Application can be started with x number of 
pricer engines and then more pricer engines can be added or 
removed dynamically according to the resource availability as well as the 
demand for more pricer engines going up and down.
 
For this particular example application, Streams Studio is used only for
editing the project files and visualizing the running application using
the Streams instance graph. That is the reason why you will not see a
launch configuration for this project when you import this project into the 
Streams Studio. You need not create a launch configuration. Because,
this application is built, run, and stopped using bash script files.
For complete details about building, running, and stopping this application,
please look inside the file named readme.txt available at the root of the 
"dynamic_scaleout" project directory.
