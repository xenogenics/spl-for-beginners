/*
This simple example shows two Java operators working fine after being fused together.
The first Java operator is a sink operator and it runs for a long time with a time
consuming task. We simulate that by sleeping inside that operator forever.
The second Java operator receives and forwards that same tuple.

This situation was used by one of the Streams customers. Hence, this example is added
to this beginner collection as a quick reference for other users.

Refer to the Java operator code in the impl/java/src directory.
